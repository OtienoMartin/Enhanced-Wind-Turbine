ENHANCED WIND TURBINE ADAPTED FOR CHANGING WIND DIRECTIONS

This is the project I did for the award of my B. Tech - IT degree from the Technical University of Kenya, 2025.

1.5 Objectives

1.5.1 Project Goal

To design, build and implement a system that is IoT powered hence enhancing efficiency, reliability and flexible operations of the turbine, specifically, for the KenGen’s Ngong Hills Wind Power Plant. 

1.5.2 General Objective

To design, build and implement a system that is IoT powered hence enhancing efficiency, reliability and flexible operations of the turbine, specifically, for the KenGen’s Ngong Hills Wind Power Plant. 

1.5.3 Specific Objectives

i.	To implement IoT powered sensors that will automatically align the turbines to face the oncoming wind all the times.

ii.	To develop an Android app that will allow the technicians to control the turbines remotely.

iii.	To build contactless electric braking system.

iv.	To stabilize the frequency of electricity generated
